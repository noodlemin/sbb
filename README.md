- Original game play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rJctconM0
- Creating the game from scratch using Python.
- Lessons Learned
  - I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including classes and inheritance. For instance, I created a Ball class and utilized inheritance to incorporate specific attributes and behaviors from the Ball class into different types of balls with unique features.
